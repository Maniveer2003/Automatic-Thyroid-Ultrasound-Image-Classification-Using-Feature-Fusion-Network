# Automatic-Thyroid-Ultrasound-Image-Classification-Using-Feature-Fusion-Network

ABSTRACT



Thyroid nodules are abnormal growth which can be solid or cystic lumps within the thyroid glands. 
Differentiating between benign and malignant thyroid nodules is important for providing appropriate treatment where ultrasound imaging plays an important role.
In digital image processing techniques, the characterization of the thyroid tissue offers the texture description using the ultrasound images. 
This project presents the characterization and classification of thyroid nodules in ultrasound images. It includes extraction of two sets of features based on GLCM and Gabor filters. 
The performance of the classifiers was evaluated with the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

EXISTING SYSTEM



The present case study reports a case of chronic thyroid and thyroid syncope associated with frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). 
Careful analysis of cough-related symptoms and ECG monitoring led to the suspicion of PVC induced cough. 
A coincidence between PVCs and episodes of thyroid was also documented by a portable multichannel recorder. 
Moreover, Doppler echocardiography revealed a PVC-induced transient increase in the pulmonary artery blood flow. 
After exclusion of other possible aetiologies, complete relief of chronic thyroid and thyroid syncope was achieved by radiofrequency ablation of the arrhythmogenic focus located in the right ventricular outflow tract. 


OUR PROPOSED SYSTEM



An affordable thyroid monitoring system is developed for analysis the thyroid level and NervousÂ activities produced, by using image processing.
This method is efficient in detecting and classifying the thyroid nodules in ultrasound images for the above said dataset. 
GLCM and Gabor filter based features are used for texture characterization. 
The obtained features are applied directly to the VGG16 and RESNET 50 classifier whose quantitative analysis is done by calculating the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. 
This method can be considered as the second opinion in improving the diagnostic accuracy

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
